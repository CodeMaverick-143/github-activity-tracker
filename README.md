## Features

- Collects GitHub events (commits, issues, PRs)  
- Stores data (e.g. JSON, database)  
- Frontend UI for visualization (graphs, charts)  
- Filtering, time ranges, repository / user views  

## Architecture

This project is organized into two main components:

- **client/**  
  Frontend / UI side (web app)  
- **server/**  
  Backend / data collection, API, storage  
- **data.json** (or other storage)  
  Example of stored activity data  

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Go (version …)  
- Node.js / npm (version …)  
- GitHub API token (for authenticated requests, higher rate limits)  
- (Optional) A database or persistent store if you want more reliability  

### Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nst-sdc/github-activity-tracker.git
cd github-activity-tracker
````

### Configuration

Set up environment variables or config file with:

* GitHub token / credentials
* API endpoint URLs / ports
* Storage options (file vs DB)
* Any rate-limiting or caching settings

For example, create a `.env` file:

```text
GITHUB_TOKEN=your_token_here
SERVER_PORT=8080
```

### Running

To run the server:

```bash
cd server
go run main.go
```

To run the client:

```bash
cd client
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open the browser at `http://localhost:3000` (or your configured port).

## Usage

Once running, you can:

* View overall activity summary
* Drill down by repository / user / date range
* Export data (JSON, CSV)
* Customize filters (e.g. exclude bots, languages)

*(Add screenshots, example queries, UI walkthroughs if available)*

## Data & Storage

* Default data storage is in **data.json**
* You may plug in a database (PostgreSQL, SQLite, MongoDB, etc.) by modifying server code
* Handle rate limits, caching, incremental fetches

## Roadmap / Future Work

* Support more GitHub events (releases, forks)
* Add authentication / multi-user support
* Improve UI (charts, dashboards)
* Deployable Docker / Kubernetes setup
* Notifications / alerts
